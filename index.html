            <h2>Our Donate Plan</h2>
            <p>Firstly we collect donations through online and offline campaigns. When somewhere inside the country any natural disaster occurs, we arrive there immediately and start to do our donation work. Basically, we work in three major sectors. <br> Those are,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="donate-plan-flex">
            <div id="food-service" class="one-third-width">
                <h3>1. Food for affected people.</h3>
                <p>Our first goal is to supply enough dry food and drinks to the disaster-affected people so that they can survive some days until rescue and rehabilitation services reach them.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="medical" class="one-third-width">
                <h3>2. Emergency medical service.</h3>
                <p>Beside serving food out, another team works for the injured people. Fast-aid and primary medicines are applied first. If needed, the patient is sent to the hospital.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="shelter" class="one-third-width">
                <h3>3. post-disaster shelter.</h3>
                <p>After a horrible disaster, an area becomes like a graveyard. Our another motive is to resheltering the affected people. We try our best to make shelters for every family.</p>

We are working there to help the people to survive. Till now we have collected more than 2 million taka of donations.And our campaigns and fundraising is still running.
